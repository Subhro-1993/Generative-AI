# Generative-AI
A Project on Gen AI for the client, Aviva during the tenure at Diligenta

At Diligenta, one of our key projects was to enhance customer service for Aviva by integrating advanced AI technologies. The objective was to improve the efficiency and accuracy of customer interactions, reduce response times, and provide more personalized support. 

Our task was to lead the development and implementation of a Generative AI model that could understand and respond to customer queries in a natural and conversational manner. The goal was to deploy a solution that could handle complex inquiries and provide accurate, context-aware responses.

First, we conducted a thorough analysis of the customer service interactions to identify common patterns and areas where AI could provide the most value. We then selected a suitable Generative AI model architecture, which was a variant of OpenAI's GPT. We worked closely with data scientists to fine-tune the model on a large dataset of Aviva's customer service records, ensuring it could understand industry-specific terminology and context. We also collaborated with the IT team to integrate the AI model into Aviva's existing customer service platform. Throughout the project, We led regular meetings to ensure all stakeholders were aligned and addressed any technical challenges that arose. 

As a result of the project, we successfully deployed the Generative AI solution, which significantly improved the efficiency and effectiveness of Aviva's customer service operations. The average response time to customer inquiries was reduced by 40%, and customer satisfaction scores increased by 25%. Additionally, the AI system handled up to 60% of queries without needing human intervention, allowing customer service representatives to focus on more complex issues. This project not only enhanced the customer experience but also demonstrated the potential of AI in transforming business processes.

For this project, we utilized a variant of OpenAI's GPT model for our Generative AI solution. We conducted thorough analysis of customer interactions to identify patterns and needs, then fine-tuned the model on Aviva's dataset. Collaborating with data scientists and the IT team, we integrated the AI into Aviva's platform. The result? A 40% reduction in response time, a 25% increase in customer satisfaction, and automation handling up to 60% of queries, empowering reps to focus on complex issues and transforming Aviva's customer service efficiency.
